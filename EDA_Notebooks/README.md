# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective
The goal of this EDA is to understand the factors affecting student academic performance
and identify patterns in the dataset before model building.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains student-related features such as:
- Gender
- Parental level of education
- Study time
- Test preparation course
- Scores in different subjects

## Analysis Performed
- Checked missing and duplicate values
- Analyzed score distribution
- Compared performance based on gender
- Studied impact of parental education on student scores

## Key Observations
- Students who completed test preparation performed better on average
- Higher parental education level showed a positive impact on scores
- Balanced performance observed across genders with slight variations

## Conclusion
EDA helped in understanding data behavior and selecting important features
for building the prediction model.
